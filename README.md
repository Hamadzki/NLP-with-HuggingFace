## 📁 Repository Structure

Each notebook focuses on a specific NLP task, demonstrating how to use Hugging Face models for various real-world applications.

1. **Emotion Prediction.ipynb** - This notebook demonstrates how to predict emotions like joy, sadness, or anger from a given text using a pre-trained transformer model. The model can help in analyzing customer reviews, social media sentiment, or user feedback. 💬😊😡
   
2. **Fine Tuning NER.ipynb** - This notebook shows how to fine-tune a transformer model for Named Entity Recognition (NER). The task involves identifying entities like people, organizations, or locations within a text, which is useful in text mining and information extraction. 🏷️

3. **Text Generation.ipynb** - In this notebook, a transformer-based model is used to generate text based on a provided prompt. The generated text could be used for creative writing, chatbot responses, or auto-completion tasks. 📝💡

4. **Summarization.ipynb** - This notebook demonstrates text summarization, where a long piece of text is reduced to its core points. This can be valuable for summarizing articles, research papers, or documents to save time. 📚✂️

5. **Fine Tuning Multi-Label Classification.ipynb** - Here, you'll find how to fine-tune a model for multi-label classification, where a single input text can belong to multiple categories simultaneously. It’s widely applicable in tasks like document tagging, product categorization, and multi-topic classification. 🎯

6. **Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT.ipynb** - This notebook leverages the lightweight DistilBERT model to analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) in text. It’s useful for evaluating customer feedback, social media posts, or any text that conveys opinions. 😃😢
